            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>The opinion of the Engliſh Doctors and Divines at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> concerning Epiſcopacy and Lay-Elders.</head>
               <p>WE thought not fit to content our ſelves with warrantable ſilence, but conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together what was fit to be done in delivering our opinions. We ioyntly conclude that howſever our Church Diſcipline had not been Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodically taxed, nor theirs avowed, yet it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us, (who were aſsured in our conſience<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that their Presbyteriall Parity, and Laicall Presbytery was repugnant to the Diſcipline eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, and retained in our Church to declare our Iudgment.</p>
               <p>We therefore proſeſſed and declared our vtter diſſent in that point, and further ſhewed that by our Saviour a Parity of Miniſters was never Iuſtituted, That Chriſt ordained Twelve Apoſtles, and ſeventy Diſciples; That the Authority of thoſe twelve was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156742:4"/> aboue the other; That the Church preſerved this Order left by our Saviour. And therefore when the extraordinary Authority of the Apoſtles ceaſed, yet their ordinary Authority continued in Biſhops, who ſucceeded them who were by the Apoſtles themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves left in the government of the Church to ordaine Miniſters, and to ſee that they who were ſo ordained ſhould preach no other Doctrin; That in an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or degree the Miniſters who were governed by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſucceeded the 70. Diſciples, That this Order hath been maintained in the Church, from the time of the Apoſtls. And herein we appealed to the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Antiquity, or of any learned man now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, if any could speak to the contrary: To this our exception and allegations, not one word was anſwered by any of the Synodiques either ſtrangers or Provincialls. Moreover, in our Private conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the moſt eminent of the Miniſtery there, we found divers times (upon oceaſion of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring unto them the Order and manner of our Church Government) that they were more ready to deplore then defend their own eſtate, and wiſhed rather, then hoped to be made like the flouriſhing Church of England.</p>
