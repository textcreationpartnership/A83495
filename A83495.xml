            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>The opinion of the Engli≈øh Doctors and Divines at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> concerning Epi≈øcopacy and Lay-Elders.</head>
               <p>WE thought not fit to content our ≈øelves with warrantable ≈øilence, but con≈øult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together what was fit to be done in delivering our opinions. We ioyntly conclude that how≈øever our Church Di≈øcipline had not been Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodically taxed, nor theirs avowed, yet it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us, (who were a≈øsured in our con≈øience<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s that their Presbyteriall Parity, and Laicall Presbytery was repugnant to the Di≈øcipline e≈øtabli≈øhed by the Apo≈øtles, and retained in our Church to declare our Iudgment.</p>
               <p>We therefore pro≈øe≈ø≈øed and declared our vtter di≈ø≈øent in that point, and further ≈øhewed that by our Saviour a Parity of Mini≈øters was never Iu≈øtituted, That Chri≈øt ordained Twelve Apo≈øtles, and ≈øeventy Di≈øciples; That the Authority of tho≈øe twelve was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156742:4"/> aboue the other; That the Church pre≈øerved this Order left by our Saviour. And therefore when the extraordinary Authority of the Apo≈øtles cea≈øed, yet their ordinary Authority continued in Bi≈øhops, who ≈øucceeded them who were by the Apo≈øtles them≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves left in the government of the Church to ordaine Mini≈øters, and to ≈øee that they who were ≈øo ordained ≈øhould preach no other Doctrin; That in an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or degree the Mini≈øters who were governed by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops ≈øucceeded the 70. Di≈øciples, That this Order hath been maintained in the Church, from the time of the Apo≈øtls. And herein we appealed to the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Antiquity, or of any learned man now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, if any could speak to the contrary: To this our exception and allegations, not one word was an≈øwered by any of the Synodiques either ≈øtrangers or Provincialls. Moreover, in our Private conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing with the mo≈øt eminent of the Mini≈øtery there, we found divers times (upon ocea≈øion of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring unto them the Order and manner of our Church Government) that they were more ready to deplore then defend their own e≈øtate, and wi≈øhed rather, then hoped to be made like the flouri≈øhing Church of England.</p>
